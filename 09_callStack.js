// Javascript Execution Context

// When a JavaScript program starts running, it creates the global execution context. 
//This context consists of two phases: the memory phase and the execution phase.

// ‚û°Memory Phase:
// During the creation phase, the JavaScript engine sets up the global object (which is the window object in a browser environment), the 'this' keyword, and the outer environment reference.
// It also scans through the code and sets up memory space for variables and functions through a process called "hoisting." Variables are set to undefined, and functions are stored in their entirely.

// ‚û°Execution Phase:
// After the creation phase, the execution phase begins. This is where the actual code is executed line by line.

// ‚û°Function Execution:
// When a function is called, a new execution context is created for that function. This includes its own memory space for variables and parameters.
// The function goes through its own creation and execution phases.
// After the function finishes executing, its execution context is popped off the call stack.

// ‚û°Call Stack:
// The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the execution context of the program. It follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
// As functions are called, their execution contexts are added to the top of the call stack.
// When a function completes its execution, its context is removed from the top of the call stack.

// ‚û°Global Execution Completion:
// Once the global execution context completes, the program finishes its execution.

// üìùNote:  the returned value being passed to the global environment, it's more accurate to say that the returned value is passed to the calling context. If a function is called within another function, the returned value is typically used in the context of the calling function.
